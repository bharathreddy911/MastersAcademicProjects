Clipping:
	array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
	np.clip(a, 1, 8)

	percentiles = df[col].quantile([0.05,0.95]).values
	df_copy[col] = np.clip(df_copy[col], percentiles[0], percentiles[1])s
 
best use of correlation plot :

	plt.figure(figsize=(15,6))
	sns.heatmap(df_copy.corr(), cmap="YlGnBu", annot=True)
	plt.show()

plt.scatter(df['Income'], df['Miles'],
            linewidths = 2,
            marker ="o",
            edgecolor ="green",
            s = 50)

My analysis:
KP281 product has 44% of values out of 3 product -  more people tend to buy cheaper products
Male holds 58% of the purchases
 60% of the people who purchase the product are Married
 Age of people who buy the products are mostly between 22 and 29
 all the people who have income above 69k buy the advanced featured treadmill i.e KP781
 People who brought the premium product i.e KP781 have fitness levels of 5 out of 5 for almost all people and only a few are with 3 and 4 rating
		and most people from other purchases are only fit with 3 rating
Most of the people who use threadmill are with fitness rating 3 and people with fitness rating 1 are not buying much
82% of the people who buy KP781 are males
Partnered tend to buy 50% of products higher compared to Single across all products


Others analysis:
it is interesting that between the three, fitness has a slighly lower correlation. This could be due to the fact that people can be high-fitness individuals in different ways 
	other than running.
	
i could have converted product from categorical to numerical, so that correlation chould have been well known
